This code sorting numbers with bubble sort algorithm on CPUlator.
This is link for IDE https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm
If you want better and more comfortable IDE, you can use Visual ARM Emulator, here is the link https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/index.html
But if you want to use this code on Visual Emulator, you need to convert your code to Visual format
